# Authentication for Spring Boot App with Authgear and OAuth2

## What is Authgear?

Authgear is a free-to-use identity platform to manage access to your applications. It uses a special OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework to confirm who users are and allow/disallows them access to protected resources. 

This example uses [Spring MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html) 
with [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) and [SpringSecurity 6](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/whats-new.html) 
to build a regular web application and it uses Authgear to **add authentication with the login page** provided by Authgear. 
The full source code of the examples can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/Boburmirzo/authgear-spring-oauth2-example).
